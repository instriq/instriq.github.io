                <h4>
                    A detailed analysis of the attack surface of the product under test, taking into consideration the security expectations, objectives and threat model. 
                    In general, our approach of vulnerability research aims to verify the resilience of all components of the product under test 
                    - typically, this service is composed of architecture review, supporting infrastructure testing, application security, code 
                    review and reverse engineering, as well as the creation of bespoke tools such as fuzzers and custom code static analyzers.
